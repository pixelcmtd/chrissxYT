### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Amplissimus](https://github.com/Amplus2/Amplissimus), [triscope](https://github.com/chrissxYT/triscope) and [AmplOS](https://github.com/AmplOS2/AmplOS2)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot, as always (quite a bit of EE lately)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sounds interesting to me (a little too many things)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with memory management (I read 10 pages of ARM docs and my brain went up in flames)
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter @nichtchrissx](https://twitter.com/nichtchrissx), @chrissx:matrix.org (email once i fixed my postfix, Signal if you know me)
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them (or she/her)

I may write a proper profile _some_ time in the future, but idk when that will be.
